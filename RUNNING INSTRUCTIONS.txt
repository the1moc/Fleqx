BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

Open powershell, navigate to the folder these instructions are contained in, and run the following commands

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
Select "A"

./build.ps1

If error is encountered, navigate from the root folder to "tools/Cake/" and for each .dll, right click -> properties -> unblock -> apply

Open the cmd in the root application directory (Fleqx), and run the following commands:

npm install
bower install

After finishing this, navigate to IISEXPRESS (C:\Program Files (x86)\IIS Express for me) or install

In CMD, navigate to the iisexpress installation folder, and run the following command

iisexpress /path:(path to project Fleqx folder, containing build files) /port:8080

This will run the project on port 8080
